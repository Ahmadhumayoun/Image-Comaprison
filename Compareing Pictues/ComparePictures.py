from skimage.metrics import structural_similarity
"""
scikit-image is an open-source image processing library for the Python programming language. 
It includes algorithms for segmentation, geometric transformations, color space manipulation, 
analysis, filtering, morphology, feature detection, and more.
"""
#----------------
"""
-->I used "structural_similarity" from metrics module to for performing SSIM
In this project it purpose is to :
> To find out similarity percentage 
> Difference between the inputs

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to 
solve computer vision problems.we can develop real-time computer vision applications. It mainly focuses 
on image processing, video capture and analysis including features like face detection and object detection
I will use opencv-python in my program to :
> Resize image
> To convert RGB to GRAY 
> For thresholding
> Finding Contours 
> To draw rectangles on it
